Student activities are a vital and necessary component of the curriculum at Jesuit High School. 
Club participation is just one of the ways our students can form and foster relationships with peers who share similar interests, 
create a positive impact on the school and greater community, promote physical and social development, provide opportunities for leadership,
and further develop their interests and talents.Wednesday Student Support Days kick off on June 13, 2021.
Whether you come to campus Wednesday mornings for academic support or choose to wait until the afternoon, all students are welcome to come for
the first of many weekly Student Activities sponsored Wednesday afternoon spirit events. All Spirit Activity attendees must check-in outside the 
gym lobby and be prepared with school ID, mask, and device/phone to display screening status.
